## 7 key elements of presentation:

* Introduce your first and last name
* Relevant academic and professional credentials (why somebody should listen to you speak on a specific subject)
* Your topic (This is the area of study you plan to present)
* eye contact
* speak loud and clear (theatrical voice)
* move naturally (being animated)
* say thank you when you're done


## Slides:

- Font: always 24
- Start presentation hotkey: f5


## Technical reports


### Types of Technical Reports
* Prior technical classes used these types:
  * Feasibility
  * Recommendation
  * Evaluation

**Recommendation Report**
- This involves researching a solution to a problem (or need), and then commending to adopt or avoid the solution. The solution is often a technology or method.
- We should limit the discussion to 1 solution for the purpose of this class (Software or Hardware)
- You will test your solution against a set of crteria (goals). If your solution passes the criteria, you will commend to use it.
- The focus of the report's results and discussion will be on research data based on the criteria.


## Basic report Structure
- Title Page
- Summary
- Introduction
- Body
- Conclusion
- References


## IMRaD Structure
- IMRaD is a report structure used in scientific and technical writing.
  - I = Introduction
  - M = Methods
  - R = Results
  - D = Discussion


## Body
- Many approaches to the body depending on the methodology used.
- The next slide contains the possible chapters you would include in an applied research report.
- Note the Methodology is based in scientific primary research.


## Mayfield Body Chapters
- Introduction
- Background
- Theory
- Design and Decision Criteria
- Materials and Apparatus
- Procedure
- Work Plan
- Results
- Discussion
- Conclusion
- Recommendations


## Chapters
- This semester we will use fewer chapters.
- The Methodology will be to conduct research based on existing published sources. This will eliminate the chapters that relate to primary research.


## Writing the Report
- This semester's report will be written in pieces.
- Each of the assignments will form a piece of the report.
- You will start with topic selection.
  - Assignment 1: Letter of Intent
- Then you will write chapters 1-3
  - Assignment 2: 1.0 Introduction, 2.0 Problem, 3.0 Criteria
- Then Chapter 4
  - Assignment 3: 4.0 Results and Discussion (With IEEE Sources)

## Elements of Technical Writing
- Do not indent
- Avoid personal pronouns
- Use headings and subtitles
- Short paragraphs and sentences
- Use white space between paragraphs
- Use page numbers
- Font: Size 11/12 for base text, 14 for headings
- Use a sans-serif font: i.e. Calibri, Arial (OACETT)


## 1.0 Introduction
- Provide a sentence on your purpose, audience, problem, solution, and report overview
- **Purpose:** To Persuade/recommend
- **Audience:** Experts, Technicians, Managers, Laypersons (pick one)
- **Topic overview:** Preview report content
  - Problem preview
  - Solution preview
  - Chapter preview (Chapter 2.0 contains the problem statement)

Example: The purpose of this technical report is to make a recommendation on the use of batari Basic to code game for the Atari 2600. The audience for this report are technicians in the computer science field. The problem this report responds to is the need for coding software that is compatible with emulators and physical Atari 2600 consoles. The solution is to use batari Basic version 1.0 for Windows. Chapter 2.0 of this report provides specifics on the problem and solution. Chapter 3.0 provides the criteria list.


## 2.0 Problem Statement
- Provide specifics on your problem and solution.
- Include 2 subchapters:

  - **2.1 Background: (name problem)**
    - Identify a problem or need that a technology can solve. Consider relevance and importance.

  - **2.2 Theory: (name of technology solution)**
    - Identify a technology or method that solves the need above.


## From Mayfield:
- If you are focusing on a problem, be sure to define and state it specifically enough that you can write about it.
- Avoid trying to investigate or write about multiple problems or about broad or overly ambitious problems.
- Vague problem definition leads to unsuccessful proposals and vague, unmangageable documents.
- Naming a topic is not the same as defining a problem.


## From Mayfield (cont.):
- Problem statements include the following:
  - The problem itself, stated clearly and with enough contextual detail to establish why it is important.
  - The method of solving the problem, often stated as a claim or a working thesis.
- These elements should be brief so that the reader does not get lost.


## Example Problem Statement
- **Weak** (lacks specifics)
- Power is needed
- **Improved** (includes specifics on location, size, power need)

- **2.1 Background: Problem - Need For Residential Power**
  - Power is needed for a single story residential dwelling in the Nation Capital region of Canada. The home will need 900 kWh per month.


## 2.1 Background: Problem
- These questions can help you identify **specifics.** You do not need to answer them all.
  - **What** is the problem?
  - **Who** does it affect?
  - **When** does it occur?
  - **Where** does it occur?
  - **Why** does it occur
- Consider consequences and implications.


## 2.2 Theory: Solution
- Provide **specifics**
- For a technology, provide information like a make or model number. Name the manufacturer.

- **2.2 Theory: Solution - batari Basic**
  - This report will examine batari Basic version 1.0 for Windows as a solution for coding games on the Atari 2600. The solution should have compatibility with the Stella emulator version 6.2.1 for Windows 10 and the physical console.


## 3.0 Criteria
- Provide the **goals** that will be used to determine effectiveness of your solution. State how you will know you have reached your **goal.** It helps to use numbers to describe the goal, but that is not always possible.
- List the title and define the goal in this chapter.
- Do not provide data [1] in this chapter. That will appear in your chapter 4.0 Discussion (Assignment 3).


### Criteria Rules
- Make your design criteria short but as specific as possible.
- Avoid vaue language (i.e. "Awesome", "Great", "Ground Breaking", etc.)
- Provide your criteria in a numbered list, with short titles preceding the explanation.
- These titles will be used later in the document to refer to the specific criteria being discussed. (Chapter 4.0)


### Examples of Criteria Titles
- **Building Sciences:**
  - Environmental Impact
  - Cost
  - Lifespan

- **Computer Sciences:**
  - Speed
  - Bandwidth
  - Compatibility


## Writing Criteria
- Use subchapters and subtitles. Try to find numbers that you can then use later to test the effectiveness of your solution (i.e. speed, bandwidth, power, cost).
- i.e.

- **3.1 Cost**
  - The solution must be under $10,000

- **3.2 Lifespan**
  - The solution must last 25 years.

- The most important criteria will deal with the effectiveness of solving the problem or need.
- Pick criteria that if passed will solve your problem or need.


## Examples of Important Criteria
- For solar panels:
- **3.1 Power capacity**
  - The solution must provide 900 kWh of energy per month.

- For load bearing beams:
- **3.1 Load Bearing Capacity**
  - The beam must support a load of 200 kg.

- For Software:
- **3.1 Compatibility**
  - The code must be compatible with Windows, OSX, and Android.


## Looking ahead to Assignment 3 Chapter 4.0 Results and Discussion
- In chapter 4, each criterion is tested against the solution. You will reuse your criteria titles in that chapter.
- i.e.

- **3.1 Compatibility**
  - The code must be compatible with Windows, OSX, and Android.

- **4.1 Compatibility of Java SE 14**
  - This chapter will then provide the data on compatibility.

- Do not provide this data in Assignment 2.

## Graphics
- Use graphics in your report - Relevant images only
- Includes drawings, diagrams, photographs, illustrations of all sorts, tables, pie charts, bar charts, line graphs, flow charts etc.
- Never put an image into a report unless you explain the context


## Drawings, Diagrams, Photos
- **Titles:** Illustrations should have titles, and these titles should be numbered (Figure 1, Figure 2, etc.)
  - Use the caption tool in word to insert these titles
- **Cross-references:** Illustrations should be referred to from the relevant point in the discussion i.e. (See Figure 2.)
  - Discuss the illustration
- **Size of illustrations:** You want illustrations to be between one-half to one-quarter of the vertical size of the page. You want them to fit on the page with other text.
  - You can resize images by selecting them and using the corner pointers
- **Placement within margins:** Make sure that your illustrations fit neatly and comfortably within standard margins
- **Level of technical detail:** You want illustrations to be at the right technical level for your readers


## Tables
- The biggest use of tables is for numerical data
- However, whenever you have situations where you discuss several things about which you provide the same categories of detail, you've got a possibility for a table


## Table Format
- At the top of each column heading, which defines or identifies the contents of that column (and often it indicates the unit of measurement)
- On the left edge of the table may be row headings, which define or identify the contents of that row
- When rows or columns must be grouped or subdivided, create row or column subheadings


## Style and Formatting Guidlines for Tables
- **Discuss your tables**: Refer to the table in the text just preceding the table. Explain the general significance of the data in the table
- Provide a **cross-reference:** i.e. (See table 1)
- **Size:** Don't overwhelm readers with monster 11-column, 30-row tables! Simplify the table data down to the amount of data that illustrates your point
- Don't put the word or abbreviation for the unit of measurement in every cell of a column. Put the abbreviation in parentheses in the column or row heading
- Right- or decimal-align numbers in the columns
- Normally, words in columns are left-justified (although you will occasionally see columns of words all centered)


## Producing Tables
- Word includes table-generating tools
- You don't have to draw the lines and other formatting details
- **Caption Tool:** Use the caption tool to put your table title on "top". You can change the "label" to "table" if it is still in "figure" mode


## Charts and Graphs
- Charts and graphs are actually just another way of presenting the same data that is presented in tables - although a more dramatic and interesting on
- However, you get less detail or less precision in a chart or diagram than you do in the table


## Formatting requirements for Charts and Diagrams
- **Axis labels:** In bar charts and line graphs, don't forget to indicate what the x and y axes represent
- **Keys:** Bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts often use special color, shading, or line style (solid or dashed)
- Be sure to indicate what these mean; translate them in a key (a box) in some unused place in the chart or graph


## Formatting requirements for your Graphics
- **Figure titles:** Include a title, in many cases, a numbered title. Don't forget to cite the source of any information you borrowed in order to create the graphic.
- **Cross-references:** Whenever you use a Figure or Table, don't forget to put a cross-reference to it from the related text. (See Figure 1) or (See Table 1)
- **Documentation:** When you borrow information to create a graphic, be sure to use the standard format to indicate the source. Put the IEEE [1] number in the figure or table title


## List of Figures/Tables
- On pages iv and v of your technical report, you will have a list of Tables and Figures

- This looks like a Table of Contents
- This tells you the location of graphics in your report
- i.e.
- Figure 1: Graphic Card............7
- Figure 2: GPU.....................8
- Create this by clocking "**Insert Table of Figures**"


## Hybrid Activity: Caption Tool
- The hybrid actitvity this week is to practice the caption tool
- Click "**References**" to access the tool
- Click "**Insert Caption**" to create a title
  - The default is "**Figure 1**" You can add a name to this title
  - You can change the "**label**" to "**Table**" for a table title

- Click "**Insert Table of Figures**" to make a List of Figures
  - You can change the "**label**" to "**Tables**" for a List of Tables


## Assignment 4: Graphic
- The purpose of this assignment is to apply the format requirements for inserting figures and tables into your report
- For 1 image:
  - Discuss the image
  - Provide a cross-reference (See Figure 1)
  - Provide the image
  - Provide a Figure Title created with the caption tool
  - Include a [1] IEEE number if you borrow the image
  - Provide an auto generated List of Figures entry
  - Include a bibligraphic entry if you borrow the image
  - See the Example
