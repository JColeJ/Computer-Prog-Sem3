## 7 key elements of presentation:

* Introduce your first and last name
* Relevant academic and professional credentials (why somebody should listen to you speak on a specific subject)
* Your topic (This is the area of study you plan to present)
* eye contact
* speak loud and clear (theatrical voice)
* move naturally (being animated)
* say thank you when you're done


## Slides:

- Font: always 24
- Start presentation hotkey: f5


## Technical reports


### Types of Technical Reports
* Prior technical classes used these types:
  * Feasibility
  * Recommendation
  * Evaluation

**Recommendation Report**
- This involves researching a solution to a problem (or need), and then commending to adopt or avoid the solution. The solution is often a technology or method.
- We should limit the discussion to 1 solution for the purpose of this class (Software or Hardware)
- You will test your solution against a set of crteria (goals). If your solution passes the criteria, you will commend to use it.
- The focus of the report's results and discussion will be on research data based on the criteria.


## Basic report Structure
- Title Page
- Summary
- Introduction
- Body
- Conclusion
- References


## IMRaD Structure
- IMRaD is a report structure used in scientific and technical writing.
  - I = Introduction
  - M = Methods
  - R = Results
  - D = Discussion


## Body
- Many approaches to the body depending on the methodology used.
- The next slide contains the possible chapters you would include in an applied research report.
- Note the Methodology is based in scientific primary research.


## Mayfield Body Chapters
- Introduction
- Background
- Theory
- Design and Decision Criteria
- Materials and Apparatus
- Procedure
- Work Plan
- Results
- Discussion
- Conclusion
- Recommendations


## Chapters
- This semester we will use fewer chapters.
- The Methodology will be to conduct research based on existing published sources. This will eliminate the chapters that relate to primary research.


## Writing the Report
- This semester's report will be written in pieces.
- Each of the assignments will form a piece of the report.
- You will start with topic selection.
  - Assignment 1: Letter of Intent
- Then you will write chapters 1-3
  - Assignment 2: 1.0 Introduction, 2.0 Problem, 3.0 Criteria
- Then Chapter 4
  - Assignment 3: 4.0 Results and Discussion (With IEEE Sources)

## Elements of Technical Writing
- Do not indent
- Avoid personal pronouns
- Use headings and subtitles
- Short paragraphs and sentences
- Use white space between paragraphs
- Use page numbers
- Font: Size 11/12 for base text, 14 for headings
- Use a sans-serif font: i.e. Calibri, Arial (OACETT)


## 1.0 Introduction
- Provide a sentence on your purpose, audience, problem, solution, and report overview
- **Purpose:** To Persuade/recommend
- **Audience:** Experts, Technicians, Managers, Laypersons (pick one)
- **Topic overview:** Preview report content
  - Problem preview
  - Solution preview
  - Chapter preview (Chapter 2.0 contains the problem statement)

Example: The purpose of this technical report is to make a recommendation on the use of batari Basic to code game for the Atari 2600. The audience for this report are technicians in the computer science field. The problem this report responds to is the need for coding software that is compatible with emulators and physical Atari 2600 consoles. The solution is to use batari Basic version 1.0 for Windows. Chapter 2.0 of this report provides specifics on the problem and solution. Chapter 3.0 provides the criteria list.


## 2.0 Problem Statement
- Provide specifics on your problem and solution.
- Include 2 subchapters:

  - **2.1 Background: (name problem)**
    - Identify a problem or need that a technology can solve. Consider relevance and importance.

  - **2.2 Theory: (name of technology solution)**
    - Identify a technology or method that solves the need above.


## From Mayfield:
- If you are focusing on a problem, be sure to define and state it specifically enough that you can write about it.
- Avoid trying to investigate or write about multiple problems or about broad or overly ambitious problems.
- Vague problem definition leads to unsuccessful proposals and vague, unmangageable documents.
- Naming a topic is not the same as defining a problem.


## From Mayfield (cont.):
- Problem statements include the following:
  - The problem itself, stated clearly and with enough contextual detail to establish why it is important.
  - The method of solving the problem, often stated as a claim or a working thesis.
- These elements should be brief so that the reader does not get lost.


## Example Problem Statement
- **Weak** (lacks specifics)
- Power is needed
- **Improved** (includes specifics on location, size, power need)

- **2.1 Background: Problem - Need For Residential Power**
  - Power is needed for a single story residential dwelling in the Nation Capital region of Canada. The home will need 900 kWh per month.


## 2.1 Background: Problem
- These questions can help you identify **specifics.** You do not need to answer them all.
  - **What** is the problem?
  - **Who** does it affect?
  - **When** does it occur?
  - **Where** does it occur?
  - **Why** does it occur
- Consider consequences and implications.


## 2.2 Theory: Solution
- Provide **specifics**
- For a technology, provide information like a make or model number. Name the manufacturer.

- **2.2 Theory: Solution - batari Basic**
  - This report will examine batari Basic version 1.0 for Windows as a solution for coding games on the Atari 2600. The solution should have compatibility with the Stella emulator version 6.2.1 for Windows 10 and the physical console.


## 3.0 Criteria
- Provide the **goals** that will be used to determine effectiveness of your solution. State how you will know you have reached your **goal.** It helps to use numbers to describe the goal, but that is not always possible.
- List the title and define the goal in this chapter.
- Do not provide data [1] in this chapter. That will appear in your chapter 4.0 Discussion (Assignment 3).


### Criteria Rules
- Make your design criteria short but as specific as possible.
- Avoid vaue language (i.e. "Awesome", "Great", "Ground Breaking", etc.)
- Provide your criteria in a numbered list, with short titles preceding the explanation.
- These titles will be used later in the document to refer to the specific criteria being discussed. (Chapter 4.0)


### Examples of Criteria Titles
- **Building Sciences:**
  - Environmental Impact
  - Cost
  - Lifespan

- **Computer Sciences:**
  - Speed
  - Bandwidth
  - Compatibility


## Writing Criteria
- Use subchapters and subtitles. Try to find numbers that you can then use later to test the effectiveness of your solution (i.e. speed, bandwidth, power, cost).
- i.e.

- **3.1 Cost**
  - The solution must be under $10,000

- **3.2 Lifespan**
  - The solution must last 25 years.

- The most important criteria will deal with the effectiveness of solving the problem or need.
- Pick criteria that if passed will solve your problem or need.


## Examples of Important Criteria
- For solar panels:
- **3.1 Power capacity**
  - The solution must provide 900 kWh of energy per month.

- For load bearing beams:
- **3.1 Load Bearing Capacity**
  - The beam must support a load of 200 kg.

- For Software:
- **3.1 Compatibility**
  - The code must be compatible with Windows, OSX, and Android.


## Looking ahead to Assignment 3 Chapter 4.0 Results and Discussion
- In chapter 4, each criterion is tested against the solution. You will reuse your criteria titles in that chapter.
- i.e.

- **3.1 Compatibility**
  - The code must be compatible with Windows, OSX, and Android.

- **4.1 Compatibility of Java SE 14**
  - This chapter will then provide the data on compatibility.

- Do not provide this data in Assignment 2.
