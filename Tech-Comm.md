* eye contact
* speak loud and clear (theatrical voice)
* move naturally (being animated)
* say thank you when you're done


## Slides:

- Font: always 24
- Start presentation hotkey: f5


## Technical reports


### Types of Technical Reports
* Prior technical classes used these types:
  * Feasibility
  * Recommendation
  * Evaluation

**Recommendation Report**
- This involves researching a solution to a problem (or need), and then commending to adopt or avoid the solution. The solution is often a technology or method.
- We should limit the discussion to 1 solution for the purpose of this class (Software or Hardware)
- You will test your solution against a set of crteria (goals). If your solution passes the criteria, you will commend to use it.
- The focus of the report's results and discussion will be on research data based on the criteria.


## Basic report Structure
- Title Page
- Summary
- Introduction
- Body
- Conclusion
- References


## IMRaD Structure
- IMRaD is a report structure used in scientific and technical writing.
  - I = Introduction
  - M = Methods
  - R = Results
  - D = Discussion


## Body
- Many approaches to the body depending on the methodology used.
- The next slide contains the possible chapters you would include in an applied research report.
- Note the Methodology is based in scientific primary research.


## Mayfield Body Chapters
- Introduction
- Background
- Theory
- Design and Decision Criteria
- Materials and Apparatus
- Procedure
- Work Plan
- Results
- Discussion
- Conclusion
- Recommendations


## Chapters
- This semester we will use fewer chapters.
- The Methodology will be to conduct research based on existing published sources. This will eliminate the chapters that relate to primary research.


## Writing the Report
- This semester's report will be written in pieces.
- Each of the assignments will form a piece of the report.
- You will start with topic selection.
  - Assignment 1: Letter of Intent
- Then you will write chapters 1-3
  - Assignment 2: 1.0 Introduction, 2.0 Problem, 3.0 Criteria
- Then Chapter 4
  - Assignment 3: 4.0 Results and Discussion (With IEEE Sources)

## Elements of Technical Writing
- Do not indent
- Avoid personal pronouns
- Use headings and subtitles
- Short paragraphs and sentences
- Use white space between paragraphs
- Use page numbers
- Font: Size 11/12 for base text, 14 for headings
- Use a sans-serif font: i.e. Calibri, Arial (OACETT)


## 1.0 Introduction
- Provide a sentence on your purpose, audience, problem, solution, and report overview
- **Purpose:** To Persuade/recommend
- **Audience:** Experts, Technicians, Managers, Laypersons (pick one)
- **Topic overview:** Preview report content
  - Problem preview
  - Solution preview
  - Chapter preview (Chapter 2.0 contains the problem statement)

Example: The purpose of this technical report is to make a recommendation on the use of batari Basic to code game for the Atari 2600. The audience for this report are technicians in the computer science field. The problem this report responds to is the need for coding software that is compatible with emulators and physical Atari 2600 consoles. The solution is to use batari Basic version 1.0 for Windows. Chapter 2.0 of this report provides specifics on the problem and solution. Chapter 3.0 provides the criteria list.
