# **LINUX NOTES**

## Week #01:

### Create file (touch):

- To create a clean file in Linux use the *touch* command
  - Ex: `touch Hello.txt`
  - Output: *Creates a new file named `Hello.txt`*


### Echo

- Displays a line of text or variables
  - Ex: `echo Jordan Coleman`
  - Output: *prints out `Jordan Coleman`*
- Another way you can use echo is putting text into a file already made, or a file you're creating.
  - Ex: `echo Jordan Coleman > name.txt`
  - Output: *no output if typed correctly*
 

### Cat

- Displays the contents found within a file
  - Ex: `cat name.txt`
  - Output: `Jordan Coleman`

### Create Directory (mkdir)

- To create a new directory use the command mkdir
- You can create new directories in any location by using either a full path or reference path
  - Ex Full Path: `mkdir /home/user/Documents/Jordan`
  - Ex Reference: `mkdir Documents/Jordan` (Assuming you're in the user directory)
