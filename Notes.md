## Technical reports


### Types of Technical Reports
* Prior technical classes used these types:
  * Feasibility
  * Recommendation
  * Evaluation

**Recommendation Report**
- This involves researching a solution to a problem (or need), and then commending to adopt or avoid the solution. The solution is often a technology or method.
- We should limit the discussion to 1 solution for the purpose of this class (Software or Hardware)
- You will test your solution against a set of crteria (goals). If your solution passes the criteria, you will commend to use it.
- The focus of the report's results and discussion will be on research data based on the criteria.


## Basic report Structure
- Title Page
- Summary
- Introduction
- Body
- Conclusion
- References


## IMRaD Structure
- IMRaD is a report structure used in scientific and technical writing.
  - I = Introduction
  - M = Methods
  - R = Results
  - D = Discussion


## Body
- Many approaches to the body depending on the methodology used.
- The next slide contains the possible chapters you would include in an applied research report.
- Note the Methodology is based in scientific primary research.


## Mayfield Body Chapters
- Introduction
- Background
- Theory
- Design and Decision Criteria
- Materials and Apparatus
- Procedure
- Work Plan
- Results
- Discussion
- Conclusion
- Recommendations


## Chapters
- This semester we will use fewer chapters.
- The Methodology will be to conduct research based on existing published sources. This will eliminate the chapters that relate to primary research.


## Writing the Report
- This semester's report will be written in pieces.
- Each of the assignments will form a piece of the report.
- You will start with topic selection.
  - Assignment 1: Letter of Intent
- Then you will write chapters 1-3
  - Assignment 2: 1.0 Introduction, 2.0 Problem, 3.0 Criteria
- Then Chapter 4
  - Assignment 3: 4.0 Results and Discussion (With IEEE Sources)
